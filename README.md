The ATM will service one customer at a time. A customer will be required to insert an ATM card and enter a personal
identification number (PIN) - both of which will be sent to the bank for validation as part of each transaction. 
The customer will then be able to perform one or more transactions. The ATM must be able to provide the available
services to the customer. A customer must be able to make a cash withdrawal in multiples of N500 and N1,000. 
Approval must be obtained from the bank before cash is dispensed. 
A customer must be able to make a balance inquiry of any account linked to the card. 
A customer must be able to abort a transaction in progress. If the bank determines that the customer's PIN is invalid,
the customer will be required to re-enter the PIN before a transaction can proceed. If the customer is unable to successfully
enter the PIN after three tries, the card will be permanently retained by the machine, 
and the customer will have to contact the bank to get it back. N The ATM will provide the customer 
with a printed receipt for each successful transaction, showing the date, time, machine location, type of transaction, 
account(s), amount, and ending and available balance(s) of the affected account.
